\title{Best-First Gale-Shapley Stable Matching Algorithm with bucket}
\usage{
best_gs_bucket(men_prefs, women_prefs)
}
\arguments{
\item{men_prefs}{A named list of men's preferences. Each element is a character
vector of women names ordered from most to least preferred.}

\item{women_prefs}{A named list of women's preferences. Each element is a character
vector of men names ordered from most to least preferred.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with columns "Man" and "Woman" representing the stable matches.
}
\description{
Implements a bucket-based, best-first variant of the Gale-Shapley algorithm
for computing a stable matching between two sets: men and women.
Unlike the classic Gale-Shapley, this version uses a priority vector/list (bucket)
to process proposals in order of preference, improving efficiency and
allowing better control over the order in which matches are considered.

men_prefs <- list(
  A = c("Z", "X", "Y"),

  X = c("B", "A", "C"),
